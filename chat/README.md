# ERP Project Chat/Backup System

## Overview
This folder contains chat/backup files organized by module and sub-module to track work progress throughout the ERP project development.

## Structure
- Each module has its own folder named with the module shortcode
- Sub-modules are organized within their respective module folders
- Chat files are named with date and description for easy reference

## Module Shortcodes
Based on the donation project ERP modules, here are the expected shortcodes:

1. **volunteer** - Volunteer Management
2. **donor** - Donor Management
3. **qr** - QR & Referral Logic
4. **royalty** - Royalty & Incentive Engine
5. **admin** - Admin Panel (Multi-level roles)

## File Naming Convention
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_description.md`
- Example: `2024-01-15_user_authentication_setup.md`

## Usage
- Create new chat files when starting work on a module
- Update existing files with progress notes
- Use descriptive names for easy searching
- Include code snippets, decisions, and important notes

```
